# Project Setup

## Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the CORS bypass server:
   ```sh
   cd server
   node main.js
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

Alternatively, you can use:
   ```sh
   # Alternative command to start the project
   npm start
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure that the CORS bypass server is running before starting the application.
- If you encounter any issues, check the server logs for errors.
